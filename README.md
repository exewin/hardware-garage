# Hardware Garage

Hardware Garage is a tool which can hold information about your computers parts. It allows you to add CPUs, graphics cards, RAM modules, motherboards, PSUs, HDDs and assembly computers with these parts. You can easily browse them and delete.

Images are below whole text.

### How to run

1. You need to get PHP server on your machine. I strongly recommend using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

2. Replace all files in **xampp/htdocs** with files from repository.

3. Start Apache and MySQL Modules in XAMPP Control Panel.

4. Type **localhost/index.php** in your browser.

### Instructions

Everything should be self explanatory. Just grab your computer stuff and start adding it to HG.

You can also import sample base located in your **htdocs/sample base/hardware.sql**. 
To do that go make sure you've started Apache and MySQL Modules in XAMPP Control Panel.
Then type **localhost/phpmyadmin** in your browser, choose import option and select **hardware.sql**.

### Project Development

I'm not planning any big changes unless the project gets popular. However any suggestions are welcome, especially when you find any bugs.
